# bladeJS

A front-end framework for building Single Page Applications.

This framework comes with a built-in router, scalable state management and template handling, so all you need to worry about is providing the content. Let BladeJS handle the heavy work!

This Framework is still under a lot of work and is not in a fully workable state.
